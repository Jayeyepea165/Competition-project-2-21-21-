        <h1>Virtual Shopping: Here's how you can try clothes on online</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="intro"> 
        <p>For the past couple of years, the stores on high streets across The US have been increasingly threatened because of high rents and online shopping â€“ a problem made worse by the pandemic.</p>
        <p>In the wake of this change, companies have started to look for more appealing ways to attract customers online.</p>
        <p>Style.me is one of the companies that has benefited from this increase in interest.</p>
        <p>It creates a plugin for websites that allows customers to create online avatars to try on clothes for them, similarly to Cher in <i>Clueless</i>.</p>

        <p>The website remembers the avatar a customer creates so they don't have to design it for every outfit they want to 'try on.'  </p>
